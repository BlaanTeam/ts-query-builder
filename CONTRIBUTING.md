# Contribution guidelines 
## Issues & PRs
- It's better to open an issue first to see if it is worth working on it, otherwise direct prs are welcome too.
- Make sure to check existing issues before creating a duplicate.

## Code & Commits
- Code have to be readable, formatted & has to follow naming conventions.
- Please no "done", "almost done" or "last push" commit messages ðŸ™‚.
- Commit messages need to describe the type of change & the change made, that's it.
- Although we highly appreciate commits inspired by [nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) or [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format) guidelines.
